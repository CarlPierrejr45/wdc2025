<h2>Luka doncic on lakers </h2>
<p>After the trade heard 'round the world, 
Luka Doncic has struggled to find his rhythm in his first two games with the Lakers, who fell to the lowly Utah Jazz 131-119 on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Doncic, who is on a minutes restriction following the calf injury, played just 23 minutes on Wednesday, and the Lakers lost those minutes by 19 points.
 You will not see that often, and don't expect these struggles to continue for Doncic, although it should be noted that it hasn't been a particularly strong shooting season for him on the whole.</p>

<h1>Luka Doncic</h1>
<p>Doncic, whose debut with the Lakers coincided with a return from a calf strain, finished with 16 points on 13 shots. 
He missed four of his five free throws, committed five turnovers and has missed 11 of his first 15 3-pointers with the Lakers. </p>
<p>In two games with L.A., both against the Jazz, Doncic has compiled 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.
He used to do that pretty regularly in one game for the Mavericks</p>
